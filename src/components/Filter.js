// In the filter component, there is a new input field for searching our list.
// _When the user types in this field_, the list of items should be filtered so
// that only items with names that match the text are included.

// - Determine where you need to add state for this feature. What components need
//   to know about the search text?

// - Once you've determined which component should hold the state for this feature,
//   set up your initial state, and connect that state to the input field.
//   Remember, we're trying to make this input a _controlled_ input â€” so the
//   input's value should always be in sync with state.

// - After you've connected the input to state, you'll also need to find a way to
//   _set_ state when the input _changes_. To get the test passing, you'll need to
//   use a prop called `onSearchChange` as a callback.

// - Finally, after making those changes, you'll need to use that state value to
//   determine which items are being displayed on the page, similar to how the
//   category dropdown works.
