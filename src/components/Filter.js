// Filter
// In the filter component, there is a new input field for searching our list. When the user types in this field, the list of 
// items should be filtered so that only items with names that match the text are included.

// Determine where you need to add state for this feature. What components need to know about the search text?

// Once you've determined which component should hold the state for this feature, set up your initial state, and connect that 
// state to the input field. Remember, we're trying to make this input a controlled input â€” so the input's value should always be in sync with state.

// After you've connected the input to state, you'll also need to find a way to set state when the input changes. To get the test 
// passing, you'll need to use a prop called onSearchChange as a callback.

// Finally, after making those changes, you'll need to use that state value to determine which items are being displayed on the page, 
// similar to how the category dropdown works.

// Note: you may be asking yourself, why are we making this input controlled when the <select> element is not a controlled input?
//  Well, the <select> input should probably be controlled as well! The tests don't require it, but feel free to update the <select>
//   element to be a controlled element.
